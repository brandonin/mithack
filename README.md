Rekeyed
---

Document sharing and permission control for everyone.


### Addressed Challenges

- IPFS: Name resolver. See NameCoin, build a resolver to human readable names to IPFS entries.
- NuCypher: Used for encrypting files on server arrival and secure sharing between different parties that visit the 'Rekeyed' website.
- Neo blockchain ensures immutability and integrity of files by storing a hash of the file (and other metadata) on the Neo blockchain. This is a non-token application.
- General Bitcoin Challenge Contender.


### Detail

Store an encrypted file on IPFS, and then share it using NuCypher permission sdk.
